Ada 2012 Introduction
=====================

   The purpose of this project is not to provide a full tutorial of the Ada language, but illustrate the features of the 2012 revision; that said, the astute reader can likely learn the basics of the Ada language from this tutorial, precisely because Ada was designed with the goal of maintainability in mind; this view of programming as a human activity is radically different than many popular programing languages and lends itself to the casual reader being able to pick things up. 

   So, without further ado: dive in!
